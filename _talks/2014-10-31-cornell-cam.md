Scientists use laboratory experiments to search for molecules with desirable
properties, e.g., that make efficient solar cells; or that cure cancer. The
success of such a search hinges on making good decisions about which
experiments to perform. We show how machine learning and value of information
analysis — together in an optimal learning framework — can be used to choose
good experiments, and to reach experimental goals reliably with fewer
experiments.

We first describe how these mathematical methods were used to successfully find
minimal peptide substrates for a pair of protein-modifying enzymes. These novel
peptides support reversible protein tagging, with application to medicine and
biochemical sensors. We then review two other applications: growing carbon
nanotubes, and finding peptides that bind to inorganic materials.
