Community detection consists in identification of groups of similar items
within a population. In the context of online social networks, it is a useful
primitive for recommending either contacts or news items to users. We will
consider a particular generative probabilistic model for the observations,
namely the so-called stochastic block model and prove that the non-backtracking
operator provides a significant improvement when used for spectral clustering.

Joint work with C. Bordenave and L. Massoulie.
