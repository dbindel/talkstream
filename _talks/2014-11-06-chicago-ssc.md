The multiparticle Schroedinger equation is the basic governing equation in
quantum mechanics. Many person-centuries and cpu-millennia have been spent
constructing approximate solutions to it. We should be glad it is so hard to
solve because its subtle behavior allows the rich Chemistry upon which life
depends.

I will describe the multiparticle Schroedinger equation and explain (some of)
the reasons it is difficult to solve: high-dimensionality, antisymmetry,
scaling to large systems, inter-particle cusps, singular potentials and
nuclear cusps, odd function spaces, etc. I will also describe our efforts to
overcome these difficulties
