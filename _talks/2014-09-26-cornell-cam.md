A recent choice model is based on modeling the customer choice process through
a Markov chain. In this choice model, a customer arrives into the system with
the intention of purchasing a particular product. If this product is available
for purchase, then the customer purchases it and leaves the system. Otherwise,
the customer transitions to another product according to a Markov chain and
considers purchasing the other product. In this way, the customer transitions
between the products until she reaches a product that is available for purchase
or she decides to leave the system without purchasing anything. In this talk,
we consider revenue management problems when customers choose according to the
Markov chain choice model. For single-leg revenue management, we study the
dynamic programming formulation of the problem. We show that the efficient
offer sets are nested and the optimal policy can be characterized by nested
protection levels. For network revenue management, we study a deterministic
linear program that offers each subset of products with a certain probability.
In the deterministic linear program, there is one decision variable for each
subset of products. Thus, the number of decision variables grows exponentially
fast with the number of products, and it is common to solve the deterministic
linear program through column generation. We show that if the customers choose
according to the Markov chain choice model, then the deterministic linear
program can immediately be reduced to an equivalent one whose numbers of
decision variables and constraints grow only linearly with the number of
products. Finally, we discuss how to estimate the parameters of the Markov
chain choice model from past purchase history.
