Practical optimal control problems involve uncertainty, which often has 
stochastic characterization. Canonical dynamic programming yields 
Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs for optimizing either the "average" or the "worst" 
case scenario. I will describe several models for optimizing the former 
subject to guarantees on the latter. We will also discuss semi-Lagrangian 
and Eulerian numerical schemes for the resulting augmented PDEs. 
The emphasis of the talk will be on the computational consequences of 
modeling assumptions.
