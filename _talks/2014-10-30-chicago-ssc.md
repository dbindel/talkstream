Multiphase flows are characterized by the coexistence of two different fluid
flows, each of them determined by different material properties and moving at
different velocities, e.g. oil and water or water and vapor. According to the
chemical composition of the two fluids they may be miscible, immiscible, or
undergo phase transitions. In the present talk, different types of mathematical
models and subsequent numerical treatments are described for certain classes of
multiphase flows. An example of two immiscible fluids is presently modelled
using Boundary Integral Equations and simulated using the collocation method.
However, flows that undergo phase transitions pose additional difficulties and
cannot be reduced to a Boundary Integral formulation, thus they must be solved
in full as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Of special interest to the
Nuclear Engineering community at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is the
water-vapor two phase problem which arises in connection to simulations of
boiling water reactors. The boiling phenomenon is described mathematically
using the drift flux model and discretized via the Spectral Element Method.
Preliminary results using the ANL in-house code Nek5000 are also shown.
