Power system operators have dealt with variability and uncertainty in power
demand since the days of Edison and Westinghouse. However as we add greater
amounts of production from wind- and solar-powered generators, net variability
and uncertainty is growing significantly, and status quo operating strategies
will not scale to the kinds of systems we need to decarbonize society. This
talk goes into detail on how we can use electricity demand flexibility to
absorb some of this new variability and uncertainty. I’ll first discuss ways to
model and control some classes of electricity loads at the level of power
system operators while ensuring the end-use service (e.g. thermal comfort)
remains met. The specific approach uses Markov chain models to describe the
temperature state evolution of populations of TCLs, and Kalman filtering for
both state and joint parameter/state estimation. Then I’ll discuss ways to
think about structuring financial contracts between customers and utilities to
elicit this flexibility. The details of the approach involve formulating the
contract design problem as mean-variance constrained risk- sensitive control
that can be solved – after a few transformations – with a dynamic programming
approach.
