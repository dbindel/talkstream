Recent research in engineering design and operations adopts discrete
choice models to maximize profits (or revenues).  Conventional discrete
choice models are mainly predictive, instead of descriptive, in that
they only intend to predict choices rather than describe the processes
underlying choice.  The consider-then-choose model describes a two-stage
decision-making process in which consumers first eliminate a large
number of product alternatives with heuristic screening rules, then
perform careful tradeoff evaluation over the remaining alternatives.

Consideration, also called choice set formation, is an empirically
validated choice behavior that has been shown to greatly improve model
quality.  From the perspective of firm strategy, modeling consideration
introduces discontinuous choice probabilities to optimal design problems,
as changes in product features or prices can change individuals' choice
sets.  We introduce consider-then-choose models, review research
suggesting their importance for use in design, and compare several
treatments of the discontinuous optimal design problem.  We use a
stylized new vehicle portfolio design example throughout.
