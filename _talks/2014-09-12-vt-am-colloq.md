Dynamical systems form the basic modeling framework for an enormous variety of
complex phenomena. Direct numerical simulation of the correspondingly complex
dynamical systems is one of few means available for accurate prediction of the
associated physical phenomena. However, the ever increasing need for improved
accuracy requires the inclusion of ever more detail in the modeling stage,
leading inevitably to ever larger-scale, ever more complex dynamical systems
that must be simulated. Simulations in such large-scale settings can be
overwhelming and make unmanageably large demands on computational resources;
this is the main motivation for model reduction, which has as its goal
production of much simpler dynamical systems retaining the same essential
features of the original systems (high fidelity emulation of input/output
response and conserved quantities, preservation of passivity, etc).

I will give a brief overview of the objectives and methodology of model
reduction, focussing eventually on interpolatory projection methods that are
both simple and capable of providing nearly optimal reduced models in many
circumstances. Interpolatory methods provide a framework for model reduction
that allows retention of special structure such as parametric dependence,
port-Hamiltonian structure, internal delays, and connectivity of infinite
dimensional subsystems. I will describe recent work that is representative of
these developments and offer some open problems to meditate on.
