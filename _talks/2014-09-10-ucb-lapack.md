Large sparse symmetric eigenvalue problems appear in a variety of research
fields. Due to the large dimensions of these problems, they are not tractable
with direct methods. Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient is
an iterative method used to resolve a sample of extreme eigenvalues using BLAS3
block operations. We explore various implementations of this method as well as
ways to enhance its numerical stability.
