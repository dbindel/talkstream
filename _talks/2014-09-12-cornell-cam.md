For many utilities around the world, there has been considerable pressure to
increase power flows over existing transmission corridors. This consistent
pressure has prompted the requirement for extending current energy management
systems (EMS) to perform on-line transient stability assessment (TSA) and
control. Such extension, however, is a rather difficult task and requires
several break¬throughs in analysis tools, computation methods and control
schemes.

Indeed, online TSA, concerned with power system stability/instability after
contingencies, requires the handling of a large set of nonlinear differential
equations in addition to the nonlinear algebraic equations involved in the
static security assessment. TSA is designed to provide power system operators
with critical information including, (i) transient stability subject to a list
of contingencies and (ii) available (power) transfer limits at key interfaces
subject to transient stability constraints. The PJM Interconnection, one of the
largest utility in the world, has successfully designed and implemented a TSA
system. TEPCO-BCU was selected as the leading fast screening tool for improving
the performance of the PJM TSA system.

This talk will cover mathematical problem formulation, theoretical foundation,
and the BCU method and demonstrate one practical application of the
theory-based BCU method on the PJM interconnection system, a 14,000-bus power
system dynamic model with a list of 3000 contingencies, with practical data in
an on-line environment. This confirms the author’s belief that theory-based
solution methods can lead to practical applications in large-scale nonlinear
systems such as power systems.
