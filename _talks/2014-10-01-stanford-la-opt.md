A natural optimization model that formulates many online resource
allocation and revenue management problems is the online linear
program (LP) where the constraint matrix, along with the objective
coefficients, are revealed column by column. We discuss optimal
algorithms for solving this surprisingly general class of online
problems under the assumption of random order of arrival and some
conditions on the data and size of the problem. These algorithms have
a feature of "learning while doing" by dynamically updating a
threshold price vector at certain time intervals, where the dual
prices learned from revealed columns in the previous period are used`
to determine the sequential decisions in the current period.
In particular, the algorithms don't assume any distribution information
on the input itself, thus it is robust to data uncertainty and
variations due to its dynamic learning capability. Applications
include many online multi-resource allocation and multi-product
revenue management problems such as online routing and packing,
online combinatorial auctions, display advertising, etc.
