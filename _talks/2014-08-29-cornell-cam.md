In this talk, we suggest a new framework for constructing mathematical models
of market activity. Contrary to the majority of the classical economical models
(e.g. Arrow-Debreu, Walras, etc.), we get a characterization of general
equilibrium of the market as a saddle point in a convex-concave game. This
feature significantly simplifies the proof of existence theorems and
construction of the adjustment processes both for producers and consumers.
Moreover, we argue that the unique equilibrium prices can be characterized as a
unique limiting point of some simple price dynamics. In our model, the
equilibrium prices have natural explanation: they minimize the total excessive
revenue of the market’s participants. Due to convexity, all our adjustment
processes have unambiguous behavioral and algorithmic interpretation. From the
technical point of view, the most unusual feature of our approach is the
absence of the budget constraint in its classical form.
