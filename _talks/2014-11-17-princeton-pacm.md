To tie a shoelace into a knot is a relatively simple affair. Tying a knot in a field is a different story, because the whole of space must be filled in a way that matches the knot being tied at the core. The possibility of such localized knottedness in a space-filling field has fascinated physicists and mathematicians ever since Kelvinâ€™s 'vortex atom' hypothesis, in which the atoms of the periodic table were hypothesized to correspond to closed vortex loops of different knot types.

More recently, knottiness (Helicity) has re-emerged as a  conserved quantity in manyidealized situations (such as Euler fluids and ideal plasmas). By presenting experiments, simulations and analytical work, I will talk about how this topological quantity can be more or less conserved than you might have expected in light, fluids and superfluids
