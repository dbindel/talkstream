The Duffing equation is a nonlinear second-order differential equation with
cubic geometric nonlinearity. This equation is named after Georg Duffing, a
German engineer, who published a comprehensive book ‘Forced oscillations with
variable natural frequency and their technical significance’ in 1918. Since
then, there has been a tremendous amount of work done on this equation and its
various forms, including the development of different methods to investigate
the associated dynamic behaviour and characteristic phenomena.

The aim of this lecture is twofold. The first is to give a historical
background to Duffing’s work and life, as not much is known about him. The
story behind this is very interesting, because Georg Duffing was not an
academic; he was an engineer, who carried out academic work in his spare time.
The second aim is related to some of the phenomena occurring in Duffing
oscillators. The dynamics of the unforced, undamped Duffing oscillator involves
a relationship between the amplitude of vibration of a typical periodic motion
and its frequency/period. A graphical representation of this relation is called
a backbone curve. The backbone curve of Duffing oscillators is bent either to
the right or to the left, which causes hysteresis and jump phenomena in the
forced equation. There may be some situations where the jump phenomenon is
undesirable. This leads us to the question of designing a differential equation
which is similar to the Duffing equation, but for which the backbone curve is a
straight vertical line, corresponding thus to an amplitude-independent
frequency/period. We answer this question both by modifying the classical
Duffing restoring force and by using another approach in which the classical
Duffing restoring force stays in its original form.
