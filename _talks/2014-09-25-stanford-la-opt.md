LR-NMR relaxometry is a powerful tool that can be harnessed for characterizing
constituents in complex materials.  The technology is used for industrial
quality control to measure solid-to-liquid and oil-to-water ratios in materials
as diverse as oil-bearing rock, food emulsions, and plant seeds.

Conversion of the relaxation signal into a continuous distribution of
relaxation components is an ill-posed problem.  We provide a numerical
optimization method for analyzing LR-NMR data by including L1 regularization
and applying the convex optimization solver PDCO.  Our integrated approach
includes validation of analyses by simulations, testing repeatability of
experiments, and validation of the model and its statistical assumptions.  The
method provides better resolved and more accurate solutions than those
suggested by existing tools.
