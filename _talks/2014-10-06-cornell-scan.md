Radar wave front arrival times and spatial energy deposition, associated with
propagation through a given marine atmospheric boundary layer, may be described
using proper orthogonal modes, and sub- sequently represented as points on the
compact Stiefel manifold. By exploiting the Riemannian structure of Stiefel,
interpolation within the cloud of manifold points is possible when solving
inverse problems aimed at uncovering in situ maritime conditions affecting
radar propagation on a given day.
