In this talk, we will review a few recent works that combine randomized
perturbation techniques with optimization. Randomized perturbations have a long
history in optimization, where they are used to alleviate difficulties
associated with non-smooth, non-convex, or other restrictions on optimization
procedures. We will focus more specifically on the ways randomized smoothing
leads to improvements in stochastic approximation and optimization, including
in parallel computation and zero order (problems in which only function values
are available) optimization. In particular, we will discuss optimal algorithms
for a variety of problem families, where the only known techniques for
achieving this optimality require randomization and smoothing, and we will
provide experimental evidence showing that the insights are not simply
theoretical in nature. (Based on joint work with Peter Bartlett, Michael
Jordan, Martin Wainwright, and Andre Wibisono.)
