Crystalline materials contain atomic-scale imperfections in the form of defects
– such as vacancies, grain boundaries, and dislocations – and controlling, or
at least predicting, the formation and evolution of such imperfections during
phase transformation is a major challenge. The phase field crystal (PFC)
methodology has emerged as a important, increasingly-preferred modeling
framework for studying materials with atomic-scale structures on diffusive time
scales. In contrast to molecular dynamics models, the fast atomic vibrational
time-scale phenomena are averaged out, in essence, but the atomic spatial
resolution is preserved. In this talk, I will describe some analysis (e.g.,
existence and uniqueness), approximation, and fast computation of solutions to
PFC and PFC-type equations, a family of highly nonlinear hyperbolic-parabolic
PDE and integro-PDE. I will also discuss a new PFC framework for
multi-spatial-scale modeling based on the recent method of amplitude
expansions. This presentation will be accessible to graduate students.
