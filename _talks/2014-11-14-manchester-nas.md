Max-plus algebra has previously been used in NLA to approximate the size of the
eigenvalues (and singular values) of matrices and matrix polynomials. In this
talk I will describe a new max-plus method for approximating the size of the
entries in the LU factors of a matrix A.
 
This approximation can be used to predict the positions of the larger entries
in the LU factors of A and this information can be useful in constructing an
ILU preconditioner for A.
