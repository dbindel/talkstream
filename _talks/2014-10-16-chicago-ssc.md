In this talk I will discuss some of our modeling efforts involving neuronal
networks in visual and olfactory processing. Already the retina performs
extensive computations that extract relevant information from the visual
signal. This processing is severely impaired if the retina intrinsically
generates substantial oscillations as is observed in animal models of diseases
involving the degeneration of photoreceptors. We show that these oscillations
arise from the bursting of a specific neuron type embedded in the network. In
the olfactory system we investigate how the persistent replacement of neurons
may allow this system to restructure the network connectivity and thus learn to
discriminate very similar odor stimuli. Of particular interest is the fact that
this restructuring of the network appears to be controlled by top-down feedback
from cortex.
