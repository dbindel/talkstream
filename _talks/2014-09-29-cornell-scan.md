The physical sciences derive "first prinicples" models for many phenomena
and then try to fit these models to observational data. Fitting procedures
need further development when the data come from time series measurements
of dynamical behavior. Systems that lack good models are even more
problematic. This talk will discuss "data driven" models of motion capture
data of cockroach and human running. Floquet theory is used formulate simple
models for the dynamics near a stable periodic orbit, and these are fit to
the data taking into account stochastic fluctuations. The analysis leads us
to pose mathematical questions about how much data is required to produce
accurate estimates for the parameters of a stochastic system.
