Symmetric tensors are multi-indexed arrays whose entries are invariant with
respect to permutations of multi-indices. Generating polynomials are linear
relations of recursive patterns about tensor entries. A set of all generating
polynomials can be represented by a matrix, which is called a generating
matrix. Generally, a symmetric tensor decomposition can be uniquely determined
by a generating matrix. We characterize the sets of such generating matrices
and investigate their properties (e.g., the existence, dimensions,
nondefectiveness). Using these properties, we propose computational methods for
symmetric tensor decompositions. Extensive examples are shown to demonstrate
their efficiency.
