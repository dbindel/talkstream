Twenty years after the discovery of Shor's factoring algorithm, I'll survey
what we now understand about the structure of problems that admit quantum
speedups.  I'll start with the basics, discussing the hidden subgroup,
amplitude amplification, adiabatic, and linear systems paradigms for quantum
algorithms.  Then I'll move on to some general results, obtained by Andris
Ambainis and myself over the last few years, about quantum speedups in the
black-box model.  These results include the impossibility of a superpolynomial
quantum speedup for any problem with permutation symmetry, and the largest
possible separation between classical and quantum query complexities for any
problem.
