In this talk, a new approach to deal with the parameterization problem of the
small spatial scales by the large ones for stochastic partial differential
equations will be discussed. This approach relies on stochastic parameterizing
manifolds (PMs) which are random manifolds aiming to provide---in a mean square
sense---approximate parameterizations of the small scales by the large ones.
Backward-forward systems will be introduced to give access to such PMs as
pullback limits depending on the time history of certain approximations of the
low modes dynamics. It will be shown that the corresponding pullback limits can
be efficiently determined in practice, leading in turn to an operational
procedure for the derivation of non-Markovian reduced equations able to achieve
good modeling performances. A stochastic Burgers-type equation will serve to
illustrate that the memory effects conveyed by such reduced systems play a key
role to capture noise-induced transitions or large excursions caused by the
noise.
