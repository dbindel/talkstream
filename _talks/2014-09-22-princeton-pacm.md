"Divergent series are the invention of the devil, and it is shameful to base on
them any demonstration whatsoever." --- N. H. Abel.

The lecture will introduce the concept of an asymptotic series, showing how
useful divergent series can be, despite Abel's reservations. We will then
discuss Stokes' phenomenon, whereby the coefficients in the series appear to
change discontinuously. We will show how understanding Stokes phenomenon is the
key which allows us to determine the qualitative and quantitative behaviour of
the solution in many practical problems. Examples will be drawn from the areas
of surface waves on fluids, crystal growth, dislocation dynamics, localised
pattern formation, and Hele-Shaw flow.
