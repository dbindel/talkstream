One classical use of SVD is for computing principal angles and various
distances between two subspaces of the same dimension. There are a number of
applications that call for a notion of distance between two subspaces of
different dimensions. In iterative methods, this arises, for example, when one
examines the convergence of a sequence of Krylov subspaces of increasing
dimensions to a fixed subspace. In this talk, we will discuss various distances
for subspaces of different dimensions, including the containment gap due to
Tosio Kato.

This is joint work with Ke Ye of Chicago.
