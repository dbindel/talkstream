This talk will present some recent advances of robust optimization in the
operation of electric power systems. In particular, we will discuss two-stage
and multistage adaptive robust optimization models and solution algorithms for
security-constrained unit commitment problems; we will also introduce new
modeling techniques using dynamic uncertainty sets and rolling-horizon adaptive
robust models for economic dispatch of power systems with high penetration
level of renewable energy resources.
