I will provide an overview of compactification in string theory and the way in
which the structure of the physical theory is intrinsically intertwined with
questions in differential and algebraic geometry. In particular, I will
highlight the way in which string theory links the structure of diverse moduli
spaces in subtle and often powerful ways. This includes relationships between
moduli spaces and deformation problems of higher rank sheaves over 3-(complex)
dimensional Calabi-Yau threefolds and the geometry of 4-dimensional Calabi-Yau
manifolds, as well as hidden connections between the Calabi-Yau and Hitchin
integrable systems.
