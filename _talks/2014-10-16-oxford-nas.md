Gradient-based optimisation techniques have become a common tool in the
analysis of fluid systems. They have been applied to replace and extend
large-scale matrix decompositions to compute optimal amplification and optimal
frequency responses in unstable and stable flows. We will show how to
efficiently extract linearised and adjoint information directly from nonlinear
simulation codes and how to use this information for determining common flow
characteristics. We also extend this framework to deal with the optimisation of
less common norms. Examples from aero-acoustics and mixing will be presented.
