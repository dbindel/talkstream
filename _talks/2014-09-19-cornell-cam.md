Computing reliable solutions to inverse problems is important in many
applications such as biomedical imaging, computer graphics, and security.
Regularization by incorporating prior knowledge is needed to stabilize the
inversion process. In this talk, we develop a new framework for solving inverse
problems that incorporates probabilistic information in the form of training
data. We provide theoretical results for the underlying Bayes risk minimization
problem and discuss efficient approaches for solving the associated empirical
Bayes risk minimization problem. Various constraints can be imposed to deal
with large-scale problems.  Here we describe methods for computing optimal
spectral filters, for cases where the SVD is available, and methods for
computing an optimal low-rank regularized inverse matrix, for cases where the
forward model is not known.

This is joint work with Matthias Chung (Virginia Tech) and Dianne O’Leary
(University of Maryland, College Park).
