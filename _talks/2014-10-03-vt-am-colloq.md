The focus of this talk will be on arithmetic properties satisfied by various
integer partition functions. I will share some history, starting with
Ramanujan's groundbreaking work in the 1910's on the unrestricted partition
function p(n) and moving rapidly to work by Robert Churchhouse in the late
1960's on the binary partition function. I will also discuss work of Oystein
Rodseth, George Andrews, and Hansraj Gupta in the 1970's on results for m-ary
partitions which are natural generalizations of binary partitions. (An m-ary
partition of a positive integer n is a nonincreasing sequence of powers of m
which sum to n.) I will then discuss work I completed with Rodseth which
generalizes the results of Andrews and Gupta from the 1970's. I will discuss a
set of "applications" of m-ary partitions to Neil Sloane's questions on
non-squashing stacks of boxes, and then I will close by discussing recent (and
unexpected) results obtained with George Andrews and Aviezri Fraenkel on the
characterization of the number of m-ary partitions of n modulo m.
