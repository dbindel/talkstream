In this talk, we consider how to represent and solve the problem of
reconstruction of x-ray tomographic images under the assumption that prior
information about the solution is available in the form of training images. The
main observation is that a collection of 2D (grayscale) training images can be
represented as a third-order tensor. From the training data, we wish to
construct a non-negative dictionary that contains prototype elements from the
images. Thus, we pose the dictionary learning phase as a non-negative tensor
factorization problem. Once the dictionary is available, the image
reconstruction phase consists of finding a sparse representation of the image
in the dictionary. Our numerical results indicate that we can get qualitatively
similar or better image reconstructions for sparser representations than using
a matrix-based equivalent. Additionally, we show that in the case of few
projections, our tensor-based approach gives images with superior structural
information than using total variation regularization.
