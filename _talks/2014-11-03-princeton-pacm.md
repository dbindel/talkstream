Over the last two decades so-called set oriented numerical methods have been
developed in the context of the numerical treatment of dynamical systems.  The
basic idea is to cover the objects of interest - for instance invariant sets or
invariant measures - by outer approximations which are created via multilevel
subdivision techniques. At the beginning of this century these methods have
been modified in such a way that they are also applicable to the numerical
treatment of multiobjective optimization problems. Due to the fact that they
are set oriented in nature these techniques allow for the direct computation of
the entire so-called Pareto set.
 
In this talk recent developments in the area of set oriented numerics will be
presented both for dynamical systems and optimization problems. The reliability
of these methods will be demonstrated by several applications such as the
approximation of transport processes in ocean dynamics, or the optimization of
a cruise control with respect to energy consumption and travel distance.
Moreover a new algorithmic idea will be described which allows to compute
invariant sets directly by Newton's method.
