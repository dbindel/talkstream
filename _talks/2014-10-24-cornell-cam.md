Global invariant manifolds play an important role in organizing the behavior of
a dynamical system. Together with equilibria and periodic orbits, they form the
so-called skeleton of the dynamics and offer geometric insight into how
observed behavior arises. In most cases, it is impossible to find invariant
manifolds explicitly and numerical methods must be used to find accurate
approximations. Developing such computational techniques is a challenge on its
own and, to this date, the focus has primarily been on computing
two-dimensional manifolds. Nevertheless, these computational efforts offer new
insights that go far beyond a confirmation of the known theory. Furthermore,
global invariant manifolds in dynamical systems theory not only explain
asymptotic behavior, but more recent developments show that they are equally
useful for explaining short-term transient dynamics. We present an overview of
these more recent developments, in terms of novel computational methods, as
well as applications that have stimulated recent advances in the field and
highlighted the need for new mathematical theory.
