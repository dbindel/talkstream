There is great current interest in the use of diffusion maps for dimension
reduction. We discuss some examples of diffusion methods applied to
understanding dynamical data, in particular combining spectral approaches with
delay coordinates. In addition, we extend the usual diffusion map construction
by introducing local kernels, a generalization of the standard isotropic
kernel. In fact, for data lying on a manifold, any Riemannian geometry can be
generated by an appropriate local kernel. This work is joint with Tyrus Berry.
