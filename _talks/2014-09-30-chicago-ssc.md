The relative entropy function plays a prominent role in a variety of contexts
information theory and statistics. In this talk, we discuss some of its
beneficial computational properties that are a consequence of its joint
convexity with respect to both its arguments. Signomial programs (SPs) are
optimization problems specified in terms of signomials, which are weighted sums
of exponentials composed with linear functionals of a decision variable. SPs
are non-convex optimization problems in general, and families of NP-hard
problems can be reduced to SPs. We describe a hierarchy of convex relaxations
to obtain successively tighter lower bounds of the optimal value of SPs. This
sequence of lower bounds is computed by solving increasingly larger- sized
relative entropy optimization problems, which are convex programs specified in
terms of linear and relative entropy functions. Our approach relies crucially
on the observation that the relative entropy function provides a convex
parametrization of certain sets of globally nonnegative signomials with
efficiently computable nonnegativity certificates via the arithmetic-
geometric-mean inequality. By appealing to representation theorems from real
algebraic geometry, we show that our sequences of lower bounds converge to the
global optima for broad classes of SPs. Finally, we also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods via numerical experiments. (Joint work with
