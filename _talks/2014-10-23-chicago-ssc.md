Thermodynamics-based models that map an enhancer sequence to its expression
readout in a given trans context have provided a quantitative framework to test
our understanding of the cis- regulatory 'code'. They hold the potential to
provide testable mechanistic hypotheses and to identify holes in our
understanding of a geneâ€™s regulation. I will present fundamental new
capabilities and applications of one such model, called GEMSTAT, that was
previously demonstrated to successfully model segmentation enhancers. I will
also touch upon the use of this quantitative model in understanding the
evolution of regulatory sequences.
