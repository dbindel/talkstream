Chebfun2 is an extension of Chebfun to 2D scalar- and vector-valued 
functions defined on rectangles. The main approximation scheme 
relies on a iterative variant of Gaussian elimination on functions 
to compute low rank approximants. Related low rank ideas are now 
employed on partial differential operators, which has allowed us to 
extend a well-conditioned spectral method for ODEs to a fast and 
spectrally accurate PDE solver. Some PDEs requiring over a million
degrees of freedom can be now be solved in under a second. Software 
is publicly available as part of Chebfun.
