We describe a framework for exact post-selection inference.  At the core of our
framework is what we call selective inference which allows us to define
selective Type I and II errors for hypothesis tests and selective coverage for
intervals.
 
Several examples are discussed including the LASSO, forward stepwise, change
point detection.
 
This is joint work with several: Will Fithian, Jason Lee, Richard Lockart,
Joshua Loftus, Dennis Sun, Yuekai Sun, Ryan Tibshirani, Rob Tibshirani.
