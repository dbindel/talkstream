For roughly six decades since the seminal paper of Robbins and Monro (1951),
Stochastic Approximation has dominated the landscape of algorithms for solving
root finding and optimization problems with Monte Carlo observable functions.
Recently, however, inspired by the rise in parallel computing and advances in
nonlinear programming methods, there has been increasing interest in
alternative sampling-based frameworks. Such frameworks are convenient in that
they use an existing recursive method, e.g., quasi-Newton or trust-region
recursion, with embedded Monte Carlo estimators of objects appearing within the
recursion. In this talk, after reviewing some recent results on optimal
sampling rates, we consider the question of how to adaptively sample within
stochastic recursions. Specifically, we will demonstrate that a simple adaptive
scheme that has deep connections to proportional-width sequential confidence
intervals endows stochastic recursions with convergence rates that are
arbitrarily close to being optimal. Intriguingly, the adaptive sampling schemes
we advertise were independently discovered by Nocedal, et al., through
heuristic (but sound) arguments and numerical experimentation.

This is joint work with Fatemeh Hashemi (Virginia Tech), Soumyadip Ghosh (IBM
Research), and Peter Glynn (Stanford University).
