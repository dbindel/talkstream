We outline a path from polynomial numerical hulls to multicentric calculus for
evaluating $f(A)$. Consider 

$$ V_p(A) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |p(z)| \leq \|p(A)\| \} $$

where $p$ is a polynomial and $A$ a bounded linear operator (or
matrix). Intersecting these sets over polynomials of degree 1 gives the closure
of the numerical range, while intersecting over all polynomials gives the
spectrum of A, with possible holes filled in [1].

Outside any set $V_p(A)$ one can write the resolvent down explicitly and this
leads to multicentric holomorphic functional calculus [3], [4].

The spectrum, pseudospectrum or the polynomial numerical hulls can move rapidly
in low rank perturbations. However, this happens in a very controlled way and
when measured correctly one gets an identity which shows e.g. the following: if
you have a low-rank homotopy between self-adjoint and quasinilpotent, then the
identity forces the nonnormality to increase in exact compensation with the
spectrum shrinking [2].

In this talk we shall mention how the multicentric calculus leads to a
nontrivial extension of von Neumann theorem 

$$ \|f(A)\| \leq \sup_{|z| \leq 1} \|f(z)\| $$

where $A$ is a contraction in a
Hilbert space, [5], and conclude with some new results on (nonholomorphic)
functional calculus for operators for which $p(A)$ is (similar to) normal at a
nontrivial polynomial $p$. The results are new even for matrices.
