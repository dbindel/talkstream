We explore the theoretical framework of the implicitly restarted Arnoldi and
the Krylov-Schur algorithm for computing only a small number of matrix
eigenpairs that satisfy some property (e.g. all eigenvalues contained in a
given domain, or certain number of eigenvalues closest to the origin or to the
imaginary axis etc.). In particular, we focus on the theoretical possibility
for implicit restarting of the Krylov-Schur algorithm with arbitrary polynomial
filter -- a functionality lacking in the original algorithm. Our results reveal
a very interesting latent connection between implicit restarting with arbitrary
polynomial filter and the partial pole placement (eigenvalue assignment)
problem.
