Motivated by a series of examples (the U.S. Ph.D. exchange in mathematics,
co-starring relationships among top-billed actors in Hollywood, and
co-citations between U.S. Supreme Court decisions), we study the general
problem of calculating eigenvector centralities as generalized to temporal
directed network data. We investigate a parsimonious extension of hub and
authority scores to "multilayer" situations where multiple slices of network
data connect similar groups of agents in different settings. By varying the
coupling between layers, we develop a family of centrality measures whose
values are localized in time in one extreme (weakly coupled) and constant
across time in the other (strongly coupled). By deriving the first terms of the
singular perturbation expansion in the strongly-coupled singular limit of this
framework, we derive expressions for principled specification of the
time-averaged centrality and the biggest centrality movers over the time
period.

This work is in collaboration with Sean Myers, Dane Taylor, Elizabeth Leicht,
