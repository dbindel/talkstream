Images are both maps of continuous physical phenomena and discrete mathematical
objects. While Shannon established the fundamental relationship between
physical and mathematical images over half a century ago, considerable further
progress in understanding this relationship has been achieved in the past
quarter century through the development of wavelets and compressive
measurement. This talk reviews simple physical models for the physical to
mathematical transformation and discusses strategies for coding the physical
interface to increase measurement efficiency. We specifically discuss novel
sampling strategies for x-ray tomography, diffraction tomography and focal
imaging.
