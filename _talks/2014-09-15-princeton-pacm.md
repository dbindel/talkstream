In many simulations in fluid and solid mechanics but even in molecular
simulations there are many sources of uncertainty, anomalous dynamics and
memory effects, e.g. associated with material properties, boundary conditions
and strong heterogeneity or confinement. These phenomena cannot be captured
with the standard tools of computational mechanics. Such effects may contribute
to large errors in simulation, often much larger than the spatio-tempral
errors, leading to erroneous dynamics or performance predictions. We will
present new stochastic modeling approaches as well as deterministic fractional
models that provide more flexibility and possibly greater rigor in quantifying
and predicting such phenomena in large-scale multi-physics simulations.
