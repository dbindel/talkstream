We study how to fit a sparse linear model when the data is stored in a
distributed fashion.  The main computational challenge in a distributed
setting is harnessing the computational capabilities of all the machines
while keeping communication costs low.  We devise an approach that
requires only a single round of communication among the machines.  We
show the approach recovers the convergence rate of the (centralized) lasso
as long as each machine has access to an adequate number of samples.

Joint work with Jason Lee, Qiang Liu, and Jonathan Taylor.
