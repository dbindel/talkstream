Matrix factorizations are ubiquitous and fundamental for solving problems in
science, engineering, and data analysis. In this talk, we consider a new
iterative approach for approximately computing certain sparse matrix
factorizations. The approach is designed to be highly parallel, with all
entries in the factorization being simultaneously updated by all available
parallel resources. As an iterative approach, the method can be naturally used
to update a matrix factorization in time-dependent simulations or streaming
data problems. This talk will focus on computing incomplete factorizations and
sparse approximate inverses, which are commonly used as preconditioners for
solving large, sparse linear systems.
