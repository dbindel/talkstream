Inverse problems are ubiquitous in many areas of science and engineering: they
are typically modeled by Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, and the
available data are commonly affected by errors. Once continuous linear inverse
problems are discretized, they lead to ill-conditioned linear systems, often of
huge dimensions: regularization consists in replacing the original system by a
nearby problem with better numerical properties, in order to find a meaningful
approximation of the exact solution. In particular, we will focus on problems
involving the restoration of digital images corrupted by blur and noise.

During this talk we will introduce some standard regularization methods, both
direct and iterative. Among the direct ones, we will describe Tikhonov method;
among the iterative ones, we will describe some Krylov subspace methods based
on the Arnoldi algorithm, providing insight into their regularization
properties. Finally, we will introduce the most recent class of the
Arnoldi-Tikhonov methods, which merge a direct and an iterative approach to
regularization. The results of many numerical experiments will be shown, so to
compare the different methods and to contribute validating the newly-proposed
strategies.
