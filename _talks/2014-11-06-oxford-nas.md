For many tomographic imaging problems there are explicit inversion formulas,
and depending on the completeness of the data these are unstable to differing
degrees. Increasingly we are solving tomographic problems as though they were
any other linear inverse problem using numerical linear algebra. I will
illustrate the use of numerical singular value decomposition to explore the
(in)stability for various problems. I will also show how standard techniques
from numerical linear algebra, such as conjugate gradient least squares, can be
employed with systematic regularization compared with the ad hoc use of slowly
convergent iterative methods more traditionally used in computed tomography. I
will mainly illustrate the talk with examples from three dimensional x-ray
tomography but I will also touch on tensor tomography problems.
