Infection with hepatitis B virus results in acute hepatitis followed by
recovery in most human adults and in chronic hepatitis in non-vaccinated
infants. It is believed that the dynamical interactions between the virus and
the immune system can explain the infection outcome. We developed mathematical
models for the virus-host interactions in human adults and made predictions on
the mechanisms leading to viral clearance or persistence. This talk will focus
on the modeling process, the stability analysis of the corresponding systems of
differential equations, and the fitting of the models to human data. Our
results suggest that transition from acute to chronic disease can be explained
by a bi-stable switch and we will discuss the hypotheses leading to such
bifurcations. Lastly, we will present the additional challenges in inducing
viral clearance in infants by modeling the strategies that the virus employ to
escape the recognition of an immature immune system.
