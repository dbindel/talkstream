Numerical analysis has a rich story of interplay between two definitions of the
condition number: analytic and geometric. The analytic condition  number is the
norm of the derivative of the solution with respect to the coefficients. The
geometric condition number is the reciprocal distance to the set of ill-posed
instances. For instance, the Eckart-Young theorem says that for affine equation
solving or least squares, those definitions are the same.

Self-convexity is an attempt to encompass some of the convex geometric
properties of condition numbers in general. It was motivated by an attack to
Smale's 17-th problem, which deals with systems of polynomial equations.
However, the results obtained so far are still limited to affine systems.

The objective of this talk is to present the basic ideas, results and
motivations. Much of this subject is still wide open, so there may be more
questions than theorems.
