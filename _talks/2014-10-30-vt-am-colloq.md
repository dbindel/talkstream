This talk presents a high level overview of regularization models for fluid
flow simulation. After discussing the analytic and computational difficulties
of the Navier-Stokes equations, we introduce regularization models as an
alternative to the NSE that are both well-posed and more easily computable.
Improving regularization models with the use of approximate deconvolution is
then discussed, followed by important details regarding numerical
implementation. Results of several numerical experiments will be given to
illustrate the usefulness of these models.
