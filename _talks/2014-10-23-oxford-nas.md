In numerical analysis the design and analysis of computational methods is often
based on, and closely linked to, a well-posedness result for the underlying
continuous problem. In particular the continuous dependence of the continuous
model is inherited by the computational method when such an approach is used.
In this talk our aim is to design a stabilised finite element method that can
exploit continuous dependence of the underlying physical problem without making
use of a standard well-posedness result such as Lax-Milgram's Lemma or The
Babuska-Brezzi theorem. This is of particular interest for inverse problems or
data assimilation problems which may not enter the framework of the above
mentioned well-posedness results, but can nevertheless satisfy some weak
continuous dependence properties. First we will discuss non-coercive elliptic
and hyperbolic equations where the discrete problem can be ill-posed even for
well posed continuous problems and then we will discuss the linear elliptic
Cauchy problem as an example of an ill-posed problem where there are continuous
dependence results available that are suitable for the framework that we
propose.
