We present a Gibbs random field model for the microscopic interactions in a
viscoplastic fluid. The energy function is derived from the Gibbs potential in
terms of the external stress and internal energy. The resulting Gibbs
distribution, over a configuration space of microscopic interactions, can mimic
experimentally observed macroscopic behavioral phenomena that depend on the
externally applied stress. A simulation algorithm that can be used to
approximate samples from the Gibbs distribution is given and it is used to gain
several insights about the model. The model has two parameters for the internal
energy of the material in the absence of external stress and a third parameter
for a constant externally applied stress. An approximating differential
equation for the expected proportion of the material in the solid phase is
derived by a spatio-temporal rescaling of the toroidal square lattice upon
which the Gibbs random field model is defined. The asymptotic dynamics of this
tri-parametric family of differential equation matches with those of the
rescaled simulations from the Gibbs field model and can account for the
macroscopic behaviors, including solid-fluid phase transitions in the presence
of constant as well as varying external stress and the associated hysteresis.
